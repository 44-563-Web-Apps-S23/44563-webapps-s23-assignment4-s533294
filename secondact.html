        Amelia, spend the evening with us, won't you? Just to show that
        you are not angry--not with me, at least. I cannot tell exactly why, but
        it seems so awfully unpleasant to have you--you--for an enemy. Perhaps
        because I got in your way that time [_rallentando_] or--I don't
        know--really, I don't know at all----

        It was so peculiar, the way our
        acquaintance--why, I was afraid of you when I first met you; so afraid
        that I did not dare to let you out of sight. It didn't matter where I
        tried to go--I always found myself near you. I didn't have the courage
        to be your enemy--and so I became your friend. But there was always
        something discordant in the air when you called at our home, for I saw
        that my husband didn't like you--and it annoyed me--just as it does when
        a dress won't fit. I've tried my very best to make him appear friendly
        to you at least, but I couldn't move him--not until you were engaged.
        Then you two became such fast friends that it almost looked as if you
        had not dared to show your real feelings before, when it was not
        safe--and later--let me see, now! I didn't get jealous--strange, was it
        not? And I remember the baptism--you were acting as godmother, and I
        made him kiss you--and he did, but both of you looked terribly
        embarrassed--that is, I didn't think of it then--or afterwards, even--I
        never thought of it--till--_now_! [_Rises impulsively._] Why don't you
        say something? You have not uttered a single word all this time. You've
        just let me go on talking. You've been sitting there staring at me only,
        and your eyes have drawn out of me all these thoughts which were lying
        in me like silk in a cocoon--thoughts--bad thoughts maybe--let me think.
        Why did you break your engagement? Why have you never called on us
        afterward? Why don't you want to be with us to-night?

        No, you don't need to say anything at all. All is clear to me
        now. So, that's the reason of it all. Yes, yes! Everything fits together
        now. Shame on you! I don't want to sit at the same table with you.

    <p class="direction">
        [_Moves her things to another table._]

    <p class="speech">
        That's why I must put those
        hateful tulips on his slippers--because you love them.

        [_Throws the slippers on the floor._]

    <p class="speech">
        That's why we have to spend the summer in the
mountains--because you can't bear the salt smell of the ocean; that's
why my boy had to be called Eskil--because that was your father's name;
that's why I had to wear your color, and read your books, and eat your
favorite dishes, and drink your drinks--this chocolate, for instance;
that's why--great heavens!--it's terrible to think of it--it's terrible!
Everything was forced on me by you--even your passions. Your soul bored
itself into mine as a worm into an apple, and it ate and ate and
burrowed and burrowed, till nothing was left but the outside shell and a
little black dust. I wanted to run away from you, but I couldn't. You
were always on hand like a snake, with your black eyes, to charm me--I
felt how my wings beat the air only to drag me down--I was in the water
with my feet tied together, and the harder I worked with my arms, the
further down I went--down, down, till I sank to the bottom, where you
lay in wait like a monster crab to catch me with your claws--and now I'm
there! Shame on you! How I hate you, hate you, hate you! But you, you
just sit there, silent and calm and indifferent, whether the moon is new
or full; whether it's Christmas or mid-summer; whether other people are
happy or unhappy. You are incapable of hatred and you don't know how to
love. As a cat in front of a mouse-hole, you are sitting there. You
can't drag your prey out, and you can't pursue it, but you can outwait
it. Here you sit in this comer--do you know they've nicknamed it "the
mousetrap" on your account? Here you read the papers to see if anybody
is in trouble, or if anybody is about to be discharged from the theatre.
Here you watch your victims and calculate your chances and take your
tributes. Poor Amelia! Do you know, I pity you all the same, for I know
you are unhappy--unhappy as one who has been wounded, and malicious
because you are wounded. I ought to be angry with you, but really I
can't--you are so small, after all--and as to Bob, why, that does not
bother me in the least. What does it matter to me, anyhow? If you or
somebody else taught me to drink chocolate--what of that? They say chocolate is very
wholesome. And if I have learned from you how to dress--_tant
mieux!_--it has only given me a stronger hold on my husband--and you
have lost where I have gained. Yes, judging by several signs, I think
you have lost him already. Of course, you meant me to break with him--as
you did, and as you are now regretting--but, you see, _I_ never would do
that. It wouldn't do to be narrow-minded, you know. And why should I
take only what nobody else wants? Perhaps, after all, I am the stronger
now. You never got anything from me; you merely gave--and thus happened
to me what happened to the thief--I had what you missed when you woke
up. How explain in any other way that, in your hand, everything proved
worthless and useless? You were never able to keep a man's love, in
spite of your tulips and your passions--and I could; you could never
learn the art of living from the books--as I learned it; you bore no
little Eskil, although that was your father's name. And why do you keep
silent always and everywhere--silent, ever silent? I used to think it
was because you were so strong; and maybe the simple truth was you never
had anything to say--because you were unable to think! [_Rises and picks
up the slippers._] I'm going home now--I'll take the tulips with
me--your tulips. You couldn't learn anything from others; you couldn't
bend--and so you broke like a dry stem--and I didn't. Thank you,
Amelia, for all your instructions. I thank you that you have taught me
how to love my husband. Now I'm going home--to him!
